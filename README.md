## 1. 3 Problems!
Today's modern screens have 3 major risks to your eyes:

### 1.1. Screen Flickering
Most screens don't have an actual adjustable brightness. They instead flicker their backlights off and on at various speeds in order to fake different brightness levels. This causes eye strain and headache! Setting a screen's brightness to its max solves this issue but it will be uncomfortable to look at! Also, a higher brightness means more blue light, which is our next problem!

### 1.2. Blue Light
Light in the blue spectrum is considered a high energy visible (HEV) which means that it penetrates all the way to the retina. This may increase the risk of Macular-degeneration and damage the light sensitivity of the cells in the retina!

### 1.3. Short-distance Focus
Focusing on the same close object (the screen) for a long time causes losing eye sharpness over time. It also leads to Myopia, also known as nearsightedness or short-sightedness!

## 2. iShield to the rescue!
But don't worry! With iShield you can use your computer without sacrificing your health!

### 2.1. Programatically Adjustable Brightness
By setting your screen's brightness to its max level, you will get rid of the screen flickering problem. You can then use iShield's brightness slider to decrease your screen's brightness programmatically without any flickerig!

### 2.2. Blue Light Filter
With iShield's temperature slider you can control the color temperature of your screen to reduce the amount of blue light emitted from it. It's basically like filter glasses but adjustable. This way you can block up to 100% of the blue light!

### 2.3 Eye-Rest Timer
Every few minutes, iShield reminds you to keep after your eyes! Showing you a popup window guiding you through some eye exercises. This helps you to avoid eye strain and Myopia. The timer itself is adjustable and can be tweaked from the &quot;Reminders&quot; section.

## 3. Additional Features!
Your eyes are not the only things affected by the long use of computers, there's more! but again, iShield has got your back!

### 3.1. Break Time
This feature will remind you to step away from the computer to rest your eyes, refresh your brain, and do some exercises to keep fit.

### 3.2. Hydration Timer
This feature helps you not to forget to get hydrated.

### 3.3. Blink Timer
Researchers found that people blink a lot less than the normal rate while staring at monitors which causes eye drain over time! This feature will cause your screen to flash quickly once every few seconds reminding you to blink. The color of the flash is adjustable and is recommended to be set to a dark color so that it doesn't hurt your eyes!

### 3.4. Invert Screen Colors
This feature can be super useful, especially in cases of reading books, documents, blogs, or any form of textual content with white/bright background and black/dark text. This feature will invert those colors in a way that makes them easier on your eyes.

## 4. Notes on usage
Please consider the following:
* Set the brightness of your monitor(s) to its max level and control brightness only using iShield's brightness slider.
* The &quot;Always keep max brightness&quot; option in the &quot;Settings&quot; tab may do that for you automatically, but it works only for laptop screens, if you have an external monitor (or multiple ones), you still need to do that manually.
* Turn off night light/reading mode features from your OS or app if you're using any. This will prevent conflicts between them and iShield.
* While the default settings/values used by iShield are based on scientific and medical suggestions, you don't have to stick to them. All of iShield's features are adjustable and optional and you can use any combination of them.
* To enable/disable protection, click on the icon in the upper left corner of the window.

## Issues / Feature Requests
I created this tool just for fun and I don't have any plans to work on it further, for now at least. I'm moving on to different projects for now. With that said, the final result turned out to be something that people can actually use and benefit from, and that's the best part! I'll be using it for sure!
However, If you find any issues/bugs in the software, you can create an issue here on GitHub and I'll try to do something about it as soon as I can. As for feature requests, you can post those too but no promises! (A feature I wanted to implement is custom/user-defined reminders. But it requires some changes on the system design, so maybe later? maybe!)
